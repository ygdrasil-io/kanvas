# Font Fixtures

This directory contains vendored or synthetic non-GPU font/text fixtures for
pure Kotlin text validation.

Rules:

- Fixture creation may download files from official project sources.
- Ordinary tests and validators must not download network resources.
- Accepted licenses for this fixture wave are SIL OFL 1.1 and Apache-2.0.
- Every vendored asset must appear in `provenance/index.json` with source URL,
  version or revision, license path, SHA-256, byte size, related PKT/KFONT rows,
  and explicit non-claims.
- The total fixture payload budget is 20 MiB.
- These fixtures do not by themselves promote complete text, font, shaping,
  paragraph, color glyph, SVG, emoji, or GPU support.
